                        Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant
                        parents who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of America
                        with the intention of giving their children the best future. His
                        mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes
                        with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was
                        his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which
                        <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for
                        fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural
                        culinary connections.

                        Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his
                        colleagues, comes from a long established family tradition in
                        farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
                        Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of
                        food sources. As he puts it in his own words,
                        <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays,
                          pays!</em>

                        Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
                        personally ensures that every dish that we serve meets his
                        exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
                        their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his
                        motto,
                        <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em>
